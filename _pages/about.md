About Me
======
Hello! 
I am An Bangyuan 安邦源. You can call me Bangyuan (my Chinese name), Aurora (my English name), or any nicknames you prefer - I have plenty!

I am currently pursuing a **PhD in Public Administration** at Renmin University of China, under the supervision of [Prof. Tang Jie 唐杰](http://en.spap.ruc.edu.cn/staff/faculty1/1bda2084ed634b079fc81a5b02b00c08.htm). He is a professor at the [School of Public Administration and Policy](http://en.spap.ruc.edu.cn) and the [School of Ecology and Environment](https://see.ruc.edu.cn). He also serves as the Secretary of the Party Comittee of the [Renmin University of China (Suzhou Campus)](http://en.sc.ruc.edu.cn/#/).

My research revolves around two major areas. One is **innovation and sustainability policies**, focusing on how technology and innovation can drive sustainability, particularly in environmental contexts. My interests extend to broader aspects of innovation and sustainability. Some of my recent projects are about EV battery recylcing, Sino-EU technology collaboration, and sustainable agriculture technologies. The other is **innovative social governance**, where I analyze and theorize creative government policies and systems. My current projects include studies on community enterprises, country finance and digital governance. I am now serving as Class Monitor for the PhD class.

I obtained my **Master of Public Policy** degree from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://ppol.hkust.edu.hk/), where I worked as a Research Assistant or Student Helper under esteemed professors such as Prof. Kira Matus, Prof. Masaru Yarime, Prof. King Chow, Prof. Xiaofan Zhao, Prof. Han Zhang, and Prof. Xun Wu. I could use Cantonese for daily conversation. 

I hold a **Bachelor of Arts in English** at [Northeastern University (Shenyang)](http://www.fsc.neu.edu.cn), where I was actively involved in student leadership roles, including serving as President of the Spanish Association, Director of the Collge Student Union, and Class Monitor. I studied English at the University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student for one semester. I also attended summer schools at Central University of Finance and Economics, Cornell University, National University of Singapore, and University of Chicago. I won Mitacs-CSC scholarship to assist in research at the University of Alberta under Prof. Karen Pollock. I also earned some national awards in Model United Nations. I studied Spanish as my second foreign language and Korean as my third foreign language.

I am passionate about engaging with society, which has led me to pursue various **internships** across public and private sectors. My work experience includes positions at Cushman & Wakefield (Beijing Office), Wujiang District Committee(Suzhou City), United Nations Global Compact (Beijing Office), and Vcun Fund (Shenzhen). 

**Traveling** is a significant part of my life. I spend my spare time exploring and documenting the world through photography and writing. In China, I have been to: Heilongjiang (Harbin), Jilin (Changchun, Yanbian), Liaoning (Shenyang, Dalian), Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong (Jinan, Dezhou, Qingdao, Tai'an), Jiangsu (Nanjing, Suzhou), Shanghai, Zhejiang (Hangzhou, Jiaxing), Fujian (Quanzhou, Xiamen), Guangdong (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Jiangmen, Chaozhou), Hong Kong, Macau, Guangxi (Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin), Sichuan (Chengdu, Chuanbei), Chongqing, Gansu (Lanzhou, Gannan, Wuwei, Zhangye), Xinjiang, Shaanxi (Xi'an), etc. Around the world, I have traveled to: USA, Japan, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

I also like to go shopping, play pianos, equestrian, play guitar, learn languages, cooking, watch movies, photography, Latin dance, play video games, write novels, etc.
